METHOD = """LOCAL QUIZ EVENT SUMMARY

One row per downloaded View Log control/attempt, in collection order. Repeated
names remain separate. Only the text actually downloaded is summarized.

Stopped viewing events: recorded stop entries before a recognized submission
event; later events are excluded. If submission is absent, all visible events
are used and elapsed time is the last visible elapsed value, not a verified
total attempt duration. Clock formats: MM:SS or HH:MM:SS. Calendar dates and
clock times in the page header are not used for these calculations.

Average away seconds: arithmetic mean of unambiguous Stopped viewing -> Resumed
pairs. Other event types do not end an away period. Zero-second pairs are kept.
Consecutive stops make that cluster ambiguous: its duration is excluded.
Unmatched stops, returns without stops, timestamp problems and missing
submission are noted. No return time is invented for a final unmatched stop.
Blank duration means unavailable, not zero. Paired interval count is the mean's
denominator, which may be smaller than the recorded stop count.

The private named CSV contains identified education records even in coded mode.
It is not included in the log sharing ZIP. It has no AI or network dependency.
The original log downloads remain unchanged if summary parsing fails.

Focus events cannot identify the website or application used or establish
ChatGPT use, prohibited activity or misconduct. Instructure advises against
using quiz logs to validate academic integrity or identify cheating:
