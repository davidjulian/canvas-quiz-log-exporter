These files retain the displayed event text and elapsed times. No computed
summary is embedded in these logs. A separate named descriptive event summary
may be saved in private/; it is excluded from this ZIP. Names in the reviewed Moderate
mapping are replaced locally. Start and finish calendar dates and clock times, recognizable
email addresses, web addresses and IPv4 addresses are omitted.

Keep private/ and its name_key.csv on approved storage. The private key links
each record ID to its reviewed name and position on Moderate. It is not in
this ZIP. IDs identify displayed View Log controls/attempts, not independently
verified unique people. IDs are newly generated on each run.

Review every text file locally before external sharing. Other names, answers,
identifiers, dates or distinctive patterns can remain in free text. This app
does not guarantee anonymization or certify FERPA compliance. No AI upload
occurs automatically. Focus events alone cannot establish misconduct.

Only rendered text is downloaded. Student pagination, hidden attempts, extra
event pages, scrolling and collapsed details are not handled automatically.
